## Project Description
Guess the Number is pretty simple and itâ€™s a good game to code because it uses random numbers, loops and input from the user in a short program. 

## Rules
The computer will think of a random number from 1 to 100, and ask a player to guess it. The computer will tell a player  if the next guess has to be  higher or  lower. A player  wins if they can guess the number within 8 tries. 


## Organization
In order to organize my work flow I used trello. The repository for this contains Python file with the game code, README.md  and a .gitigmore  file.
